                    <p class="textJustify">ForexMart ascribes to the regulation of the Autorité des marchés financiers. The Paris-based regulatory body overseeing financial products and services, and financial markets as well to protect clients. The Cypriot investment firm is supervised across all EU member countries. Our license is fully acceptable by the AMF and all activities conform to the existing law in France.</p>

                        <p class="textJustify">French residents can benefit from the services provided by ForexMart. A holder of MiFID financial license, the firm reviews its "think global, act local" manner of dealing with clients.</p>
                        <p class="textJustify">The AMF, regulated by the Financial Security Act 2003, regulates all partnerships with clients. Also, clients’ investment money are maintained in a secure place. That is why many traders stick with the company when it comes to entering financial markets.</p>
