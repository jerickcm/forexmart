$lang['tac_269']='  In order for us to provide Price Quotes with the swiftness normally associated with speculative trading, we may have to rely on available price or available information that may later prove to be faulty due to specific market circumstances, for instance, but not limited to, lack of liquidity in, or suspension of an Underlying Instrument or asset or errors in feeds from information providers or in Price Quotes from our counterparties. In these circumstances, provided that we have acted in good faith when providing the relevant Price Quote to you, we may cancel the relevant Transaction and/or Contract with you, but shall do so within reasonable time and shall provide you with a full explanation for the reason of such cancellation.';
$lang['tac_270']='     Following execution of any position with you, we may, at our reasonable discretion, subsequently offset each such position with you with another client position or with a position with one of our counterparties, or we may decide to retain a proprietary position in the Market with the intention to obtain trading profits from such positions. Such decisions and actions may therefore result in us offsetting client positions at prices different – sometimes significantly different – from the Price Quotes provided to you, resulting in trading profits or losses for us. This in turn can raise the possibility of you incurring, what may be seen as, an implied cost (i.e., the difference between the price at which you traded with us and the price at which we subsequently traded with our counterparties and/or other clients), due to any profits realised by us as a result of the Market Making function. Please also note, however, that the Market Making function may involve significant costs to us, if the market moves against us in comparison to the price at which we traded with you.';

$lang['tac_273']=' You acknowledges, recognize and accept that the Price Quotes provided to you include a ‘spread’ when compared with the price for which we may have covered or expected to be able to ‘cover’ the Transaction or Contract in a trade with another client or a counterparty; furthermore, you acknowledges, recognize and accept that said ‘spread’ constitutes remuneration to us and that such ‘spread’ cannot necessarily be calculated individually for all Transactions and/or Contracts and that such ‘spread’ will not be specified at the Settlement/Trade Confirmation or otherwise revealed to you';
$lang['tac_274']=' Any commission costs, interest charges, costs associated to and included in the ‘spreads’ that are part of the Price Quotes provided by us as a Market Maker in certain Markets, and any other fees and charges will consequently influence you trading result(s) and may have a negative effect on your trading performance compared to a situation in which such commission costs, interest charges, costs associated to and included in the’ spreads’, would not apply.';
