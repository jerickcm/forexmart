The Sum Available for Withdrawal (without bonus) indicates the maximum amount a client can take away from his account. Please note in case of maximum sum withdrawal, the bonus can be cancelled. On the other hand, the Sum Available for Withdrawal (with bonus safe) shows the max amount a client can withdraw from his trading account without affecting the bonus.<br>
Please bear in mind we determine the aggregate amount available for withdrawal referring to the actual trading account's margin.";
